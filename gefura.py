"""Gefura measures for 'bridges' between node groups in a network

These measures are adaptations of betweenness centrality where only shortest
paths between nodes from different groups are taken into account. The gefura
measures thus gauge the extent to which a node bridges between groups (old
Greek γεφυρα = bridge).

This module implements global and local gefura. Both directed and
undirected, as well as weighted and unweighted networks are supported.
